ver 1.1

Sun 24 Feb 2013 05:26:29 AM EST 

Faint was too faint in-game, so I made 'em look more the way I expected.

Fixed recipes for pastel and faint blocks.

Also, made certain the faint blocks return two buckets instead of only one.

Think everything's in order.

ver 0.9

Sat 23 Feb 2013 05:23:17 5M EST 

Added light colors.
Attempted to order colors by hue.
Turned out to be a lot harder than imagined.

alpha-numeric order is goofy.

I was thinking it was doing:  1, 10, 11, 12, 2, 3, 4...
but it was doing:  10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4...

ver 0.8

Sat 23 Feb 2013 01:18:24 AM EST

---------


ver 0.7

Sat 23 Feb 2013 01:01:22 AM EST 

Added full saturation Medium and Dark shades.

ver 0.6

Fri 22 Feb 2013 08:27:53 PM EST

Fixed a bug where I forgot a comma in the script.
Nothing major, but it wouldn't load unless it was in the right spot.

The blocks light up nice and bright.  Quite saturated.
Perhaps too intense for my purposes.
 
Will create more subdued colors, much more like actual stained glass.
Especially pastels, and flesh tones.

Perhaps turn the light intensity down.
Maybe make some/all of them out of standard glow glass instead.

ver 0.5

Fri 22 Feb 2013 06:42:24 PM EST 

Essentially the first version, but I'm starting at ver 0.5 because I want to check for bugs before it's released.

Has the Full saturation colors included.  (except for yellow, as super-glow-glass is already)
Haven't decided if/when I'll include the other colors.
Perhaps some/all eventually.
