# Darkage mod for Minetest
This mod adds some new blocks that allow pre-industrial looking buildings to be made.
Of course, feel free to use them for any other type of construction.

This mod originally created by MasterGollum and is now maintained and being improved upon by addi and CraigyDavi.

**Depends:** default, stairs?, stairsplus?

**License:** Code and textures, [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/)

**Installation:** Unzip the file and rename it to "darkage". Then move it to the mod directory.
