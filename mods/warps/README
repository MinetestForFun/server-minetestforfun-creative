"Warps" - a simple warp mod for minetest.

========

/setwarp [name]
/delwarp [name]
/warp [name]
/listwarps

priv: warp_admin - set/change/delete warps
priv: warp_user  - list, and use warps

warps are stored in the world folder file "warps.txt".

A warpstone can be given or found in the creative inventory (item
id: warps:warpstone). This warpstone can be placed on the ground
and be programmed to warp players who punch it to a certain warp
location (one of the warps in /listwarps). Right-clicking the item
as a warp_admin user will allow you to program the warpstone. The
warpstone can be removed by shift-punching the warp stone.

All warps are delayed by ~5 seconds. You have to stand still for
that duration, otherwise the warp will be cancelled. This may avoid
warp spamming and warping out of combat a bit. There's a bit
of variation in time due to the timer resolution in minetest
being rather large.
