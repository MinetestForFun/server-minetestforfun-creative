Its only 2 agruments.
You are not alowed to take files from the mod and use to other things (but ok to link form other mods).
You have to show me (UjEdwin) as the orginal creater (if you want to make another version / spread the mod)

It does not mather what you is doing with the mod as long you folow this 2 agruments.

So: its ok to do stuff like: use in public servers/edit/spread/upload/make an update / using in a video (like youtube)...


The reasons the the arguments.
It does not feel good if someone takes hard work and or characteristics of your work, and says its him self created it.
In some mods i spended more then 30 hours... so its a good reason to add this license :-)
